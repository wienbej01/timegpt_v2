# Architecture Overview

The `io` layer contains readers such as `gcs_reader` responsible for fetching and normalising raw intraday bars before quality checks. `quality` defines strict data contracts and validation routines that gate all ingestion before downstream steps. `fe` hosts feature engineering primitives and deterministic enrichments used to construct leakage-safe matrices. `framing` components translate validated data into payloads and request frames for external services. `forecast` wraps the TimeGPT client and the scheduling logic that triggers horizon snapshots. `trading` captures portfolio construction logic including rules and transaction cost handling. `backtest` implements the simulation engine and grid evaluation to measure performance under varying parameters. `eval` packages the metrics, calibration, and reporting signals required to benchmark the system. `reports` assembles the user-facing artefacts that summarize each run. `utils` provides common utilities for datetimes, logging, caching, event management, and synthetic fixtures used across modules.
