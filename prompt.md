▌ You are an expert Python infra+quant engineer. you are the head of quant trading system development at a hedge fund and Chief Data Scientist. Open the repository root and
▌ read SPRINTS.md carefully. Implement exactly what SPRINTS.md prescribes, starting with Sprint 0 then Sprint 1, following the coding standards and CLI_contract defined
▌ there. Use codex.config.yaml for environment, install, lint, and test commands.
▌
▌ Instructions:
▌ 1) Load SPRINTS.md at repo root and follow its tasks and acceptance criteria verbatim.
▌ 2) Create/modify files only within the allowed_write_paths from codex.config.yaml.
▌ 3) After completing Sprint 0 and Sprint 1:
▌    - Run the acceptance_checks defined in codex.config.yaml in order.
▌    - Ensure pre-commit, lint, and tests pass.
▌    - Commit with persona-stamped messages and push to main.
▌ 4) Do not restate or reinterpret the sprint steps here; the source of truth is SPRINTS.md.
▌
▌ Begin now by opening SPRINTS.md and executing Sprint 0, then Sprint 1.
